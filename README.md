# Awesome-papers-about-Code-LLM-and-Agents

In the following google doc., we categorize and summarize recent papers on the whole pipeline of code LLMs. 
It starts from pre-training and fine-tuning datasets and foundation models to newly emerging fine-tuning techniques and agents. 
The fine-tuning parts include the latest topic of test-phase reasoning. 
The agent part includes the top-ranked open-source coding and SE agents, covering different topics, such as patching and debugging.
